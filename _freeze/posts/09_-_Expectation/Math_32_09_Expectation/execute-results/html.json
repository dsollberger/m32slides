However, the following *practical formula* is better for hand calculations and computer calculations.\n:::\n\n**Claim:** \n\n$$\\text{Var}(X) = \\text{E}[X^{2}] - \\left(\\text{E}[X]\\right)^{2}$$\n\n## Example: Boxing Bets\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"75%\"}\nBefore watching a boxing match, my friends and I made bets over which round the fight would end.  A boxing match lasts up to 12 rounds.  Each gambler pays \\$5 and is assigned a round randomly.  The winner garners the whole pot of money.  What is the expected value of the bet?  What is the variance of the bet?\t\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"25%\"}\n![](CaneloVersusMayweather.png)\n:::\n\n::::\n\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n- due Fri., Feb. 10:\n  - WHW4\n  - JHW2\n  - Demographics Part 1 (survey)\n- Be mindful of before-lecture quizzes\t\n\nNo lecture session for Math 32: \n\n* Feb 20, Mar 10, Mar 24\n  \nExam 1 will be on Wed., Mar. 1\n\n  - more information in weekly announcements\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](mean_joke.png)\n\n[source](https://mobile.twitter.com/sgadarian/status/1569378193370480642)\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\t\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n:::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n\n\n::::\n",
