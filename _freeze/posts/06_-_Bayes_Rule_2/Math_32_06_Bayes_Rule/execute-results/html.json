Let $H^{c}$ be the event that an e-mail is \"spam\".  Let $W$ be the event that an e-mail contains a trigger word such as \"watches\".  Suppose that\n\n- the probability that an e-mail contains that word given that it is spam is 17\\%\n- the probability that an e-mail contains that word given that it is not spam is 9\\%\n- the probability that a randomly selected e-mail message is spam is 80\\%\n\nFind the probability that an e-mail message is spam, given that the trigger word appears.\n\n## Example: Quality Control\n\nA manufacturing process produces integrated circuit chips.  Over the long run the fraction of bad chips produced by the process is around 20\\%.  Thoroughly testing a chip to determine whether it is good or bad is rather expensive, so a cheap test is tried.  All good chips will pass the cheap test, but so will 10\\% of the bad chips.  Given that a chip passes the test, what is the probability that the chip was defective?\n\n\n\n\n\n## Example: DUI Checkpoint\n\nA breath analyzer, used by the police to test whether drivers exceed the legal limit set for the blood alcohol percentage while driving, is known to satisfy\n\n$$P(A|B) = P(A^{c}|B^{c}) = x$$\n\t\nwhere $A$ is the event \"breath analyzer indicates that legal limit is exceeded\" and $B$ \"driver's blood alcohol percentage exceeds legal limit.\"  On Saturday nights, about 4\\% of the drivers are known to exceed the limit.\n\n- Describe in words the meaning of $P(B|A)$\n- Determine $P(B|A)$ if $x = 0.90$\n- How big should $x$ be so that $P(B|A) \\geq 0.95$?\n\n## Example: Disease Outbreak\n\nSuppose that at UC Merced, there is a two percent chance that a freshman has herpes at the end of the school year.  Let $H$ be the event of having the virus, while $C$ represents the event that the freshman is from the Cathedral dorm.  Among the herpes carriers, the probably of being a Cathedral resident is 32\\%.  Among those free of disease, the probably of being a Cathedral resident is 13\\%.  What is the probability that a freshman has herpes, given that you know that he or she lived in the Cathedral dorm?\n\n## Generalized Bayes' Rule\n\nIf we are conditioning $B$ on an event $A$, where the latter can be partitioned into several subsets,\n\n$$A = \\{ A_{1}, A_{2}, ..., A_{j} \\}$$\n\nthen the total probability is\n\n$$P(B) = P(B|A_{1}) \\cdot P(A_{1}) + P(B|A_{2}) \\cdot P(A_{2}) + ... + P(B|A_{n}) \\cdot P(A_{n})$$\n\nand Bayes Rule for computing the probability of $A_{i}$ given $B$ becomes\n\n$$P(A_{i}|B) = \\ds\\frac{ P(B|A_{i}) \\cdot P(A_{i}) }{ P(B|A_{1}) \\cdot P(A_{1}) + P(B|A_{2}) \\cdot P(A_{2}) + ... + P(B|A_{n}) \\cdot P(A_{n}) }$$\n\n## Bayesian Odds\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nThe **Bayesian odds** of event $A$ to event $B$ given that event $C$ has already taken place is\n$$\\ds\\frac{ P(A|C) }{ P(B|C) }$$ \n:::\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n- due Fri., Feb. 3:\n  - WHW3\n  - JHW1\n  - Identity Statement (short essay)\n- and the before-lecture quizzes\t\n  \nExam 1 will be on Wed., Mar. 1\n\nDiscussion section 24D (Wed., 530 PM) now meets in GRAN 135\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n![](hymm.png)\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\t\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n:::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n\n\n::::\n",
