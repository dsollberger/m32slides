What is the probability that we have a long month given that we are in the Fall semester?\n\n\n$$F = \\{ \\text{Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec} \\}$$\n\n## Conditional Probability\n\nWe can condense this process into a formula for conditional probability:\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nThe **conditional probability** of observing event $A$ *given* event $B$ has already taken place is\n\n\n$$P(A|B) = \\ds\\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\n\n:::\n\n## Example: Contigency Tables\n\nIn this hypothetical example, suppose that we are following an epidemiologist who is testing patients at a hospital in for the novel strain of coronavirus.\n\n(A) Build a contingency table with the following data\n\n- 175 true positives\n- 32 false negatives\n- 18 false positives\n- 2019 true negatives\n\n(B) Compute the probability that a randomly selected patient is disease free given that the drug test is positive.\n\n## Prosecutor's Fallacy\n\n(C) Using the same counts as the previous example, compute the probability that for a randomly selected patient the test returns positive given that the patient is disease free.\n\n:::{.callout-warning}\nConverses for conditional probability are almost never equal.\n\n\n$$P(A|B) \\neq P(B|A)$$\n\n:::\n\n## Bayes' Rule\n\nIn the previous section, we studied conditional probability\n\n$$P(B|A) = \\ds\\frac{P(A \\text{ and } B)}{P(A)}$$\n\nand we talked about how the inverse probabilities $P(A|B)$ and $P(B|A)$ are almost never equal.  In this section, we discuss how to properly think and calculate that inverse probability.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\nAnother look at conditional probability is\n\n$$P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)$$\n\nThis is read as \"The probability of the intersection $A$ and $B$ is the probability of event $B$ *conditioned* on event $A$.\"\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\nMoreover, if we consider how if event $B$ is dependent on event $A$, then sometimes $B$ happens when $A$ happens and sometimes when $A$ does not occur.  More succinctly, the *total probability* of event $B$ is\n\n$$P(B) = P(B|A) \\cdot P(A) + P(B|A^{c}) \\cdot P(A^{c})$$ \n\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nStaring with the conditional probability formula\n\n$$P(B|A) = \\ds\\frac{P(A \\text{ and } B)}{P(A)}$$\n\n*Bayes' Rule* combines the ideas of conditioned probability and total probability as\n\n$$P(A|B) = \\ds\\frac{P(A \\text{ and } B)}{P(B)} = \\ds\\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A) + P(B|A^{c}) \\cdot P(A^{c})}$$\n\n:::\n\n## A Deep Dive\n\n:::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Example\n\nAn executive has their blood tested for boneitis.  Let $B$ be the event that an executive has the disease, and let $T$ be the event that the test returns positive.  Laboratory trials yielded the following information:\n\n\n$$P(T|B) = 0.70 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad P(T|B^{c}) = 0.10$$\n\n\nAssume a prior probability of $P(B) = 0.0032$.
