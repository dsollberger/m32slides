This is to ease the reader into more complicated examples.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nA **possibility space** is a set of all of the possible outcomes.\n:::\n\n## Example 1: One Die\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"75%\"}\nConsider rolling one six-sided die. For each of the following events, list their possible ways, and then find their probabilities:\n\n- A: rolling an even number\n- B: rolling a number greater than 3\n- C: rolling a double-digit number\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"25%\"}\n![one, six-sided die](die.png)\n:::\n::::\n\n## Starting to Combine\n\nAt first, we consider simply adding up the probabilities to compute the probability of the union of the probabilities:\n\n\n$$P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) = ?$$\n\n## Inconsistent?\n\nSo far, \n\n\n$$P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) = 100\\%$$\n\nWhat went wrong? (Discuss with a neighbor)\n\n## Some Set Notation\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\nThe **union** of sets A and B is the set of all elements that appear either in set A OR set B\n\n$$A \\cup B = \\{x : x \\in A \\text{ OR } x \\in B\\}$$\n\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\nThe **intersection** of sets A and B is the set of all elements that appear both in set A AND set B\n\n$$A \\cap B = \\{x : x \\in A \\text{ AND } x \\in B\\}$$\n\n:::\n\n## Inclusion-Exclusion Principle\n\nWe observe that there was an *overlap* in the calculation.  Since some elements were counted twice, we can compensate by subtracting one copy of that overlap.  This notion is called the **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nTo compute the probability of a set union, we need to consider the overlapping portions.  For two sets A and B, the probability of observing the union is\n\n$$P(A \\cup B) = {\\color{red}P(A)} + {\\color{blue}P(B)} - {\\color{purple}P(A \\cap B)}$$\n\n:::\n\n## Example 2: Two dice\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"75%\"}\nConsider rolling two six-sided dice. Find the probability that their total is 8 or the\nsecond die shows a number greater or equal to 5.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"25%\"}\n![two dice](twodice.png)\n:::\n::::\n\n## Subtlety in Assumptions\n\nIn the previous example, we assumed a notion of **sampling with replacement**. That is, when rolling dice, we know that a number can be repeated. In other situations were observations cannot repeat, we are **sampling without replacement**.\n\n## Example 3: Faculty Matters\n\n:::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n### Prompt\n\nConsider a subset of the UC Merced Applied Math department with 6 faculty members—Blanchette, Buvoli, Sandoval, Stepanian, Thompson, Yatskar—must select two of its members to serve on a personnel review committee. Because the work will be time-consuming, no one is anxious to serve, so it is decided that the representatives will be selected by putting 6 slips of paper in a box, mixing them, and selecting two without replacement.\n\n- What is the probability that both Thompson and Yatskar will be selected?\n- What is the probability that at least one of the two members whose name begins with ‘B’ is selected?\n- If the 6 faculty members have taught for 15, 3, 5, 9, 4, and 12 years, respectively, at the university, what is the probability that the two chosen representatives have at least a combined 10 years’ teaching experience at the university?\n\n### Sample Space 1\n\n![](faculty1.png)\n\n### Sample Space 2\n\n![](faculty2.png)\n\n::::\n\n## Assuming a Distribution\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the coin flip has two disjoint outcomes---`heads` or `tails`---with probabilities\n\n\n$$P(\\text{heads}) = 0.5, \\quad P(\\text{tails}) = 0.5$$\n\n![](twocoins.png)\n\nIn the early formation of the field of statistics, there were considerations such as the following.  How should the possibility space for a trial of flipping two coins be represented?\n\n- 3 elements: $\\{$two heads, mixed result, two tails$\\}$, OR\n- 4 elements: $\\{$HH, HT, TH, TT$\\}$\n\n## Complements\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nTo sets are **disjoint** if\n\n$$P(A \\cap B) = 0$$\n\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nA **possibility space** is a set of all of the possible outcomes for an event.  It is usually denoted by the Greek letter capital omega.\n:::\n\nFor example, the set of all outcomes for two coin flips of a fair coin turns out to be\n\n\n$$\\Omega = \\{HH, HT, TH, TT\\}$$\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nIf $A$ is a set (and a subset of the possibility space), then the **complement** of A, denoted $A^{c}$, is the set of outcomes that is in the universal set but not in the set A\n\n\n$$A \\subseteq \\Omega \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad A^{c} = \\Omega - A$$\n\n:::\n\n## Example 4: One Die\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"25%\"}\n![](die.png)\t\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"75%\"}\nFor example, if we think of our roll of a six-sided die, the possibility space was\n\n$$\\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$$\n\nIf we have a subset consisting of the even numbers \n\n$$E = \\{2, 4, 6\\}$$\n\nwhat do you think the complement $E^{c}$ will be?\n:::\n\n::::\n\n## Empty Set\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nThe empty set $\\{\\}$ literally has zero elements in the set\n:::\n\n**Claim**: Set $A$ and its complement are disjoint.\n\n## Example 5: Replacement\n\nThere may be situations where we need to be careful about whether selections from a set were done **with replacement** or **without replacement**.\n\nIn the wardrobe, there are 8 blue socks and 6 red socks.\n\n\n$$B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B$$\n\n$$R, R, R, R, R, R$$\n\n\nCompute the following probabilities\n\n- Selecting 3 red socks with replacement\n- Selecting 3 red socks without replacement\n- Selecting 4 blue socks with replacement\n- Selecting 4 blue socks without replacement\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\nNotice how when we sample with replacement, each iteration is **independent** of the previous iterations.  When we sample without replacement, each iteration **depends** on the previous iterations.\n:::\n\n## De Morgan's Law\n\nOne relationship between the notions of complements, intersections, and unions is as follows.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n\n$$(A \\cup B)^{c} = A^{c} \\cap B^{c}$$\n\nThe complement of the union is the intersection of the complements.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\t\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n:::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n\n\n::::\n",
