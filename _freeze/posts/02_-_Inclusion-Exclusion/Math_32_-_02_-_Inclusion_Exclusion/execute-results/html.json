This is to ease the reader into more complicated examples.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nA **possibility space** is a set of all of the possible outcomes.\n:::\n\n## Example 1: One Die\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"75%\"}\nConsider rolling one six-sided die. For each of the following events, list their possible ways, and then find their probabilities:\n\n- A: rolling an even number\n- B: rolling a number greater than 3\n- C: rolling a double-digit number\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"25%\"}\n![one, six-sided die](die.png)\n:::\n::::\n\n## Starting to Combine\n\nAt first, we consider simply adding up the probabilities to compute the probability of the union of the probabilities:\n\n$$P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) = ?$$\n## Inconsistent?\n\nSo far, \n\n$$P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) = 100\\%$$\nWhat went wrong? (Discuss with a neighbor)\n\n## Some Set Notation\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\nThe **union** of sets A and B is the set of all elements that appear either in set A OR set B\n$$A \\cup B = \\{x : x \\in A \\text{ OR } x \\in B\\}$$\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\nThe **intersection** of sets A and B is the set of all elements that appear both in set A AND set B\n$$A \\cap B = \\{x : x \\in A \\text{ AND } x \\in B\\}$$\n:::\n\n## Inclusion-Exclusion Principle\n\nWe observe that there was an *overlap* in the calculation.  Since some elements were counted twice, we can compensate by subtracting one copy of that overlap.  This notion is called the **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nTo compute the probability of a set union, we need to consider the overlapping portions.  For two sets A and B, the probability of observing the union is\n$$P(A \\cup B) = {\\color{red}P(A)} + {\\color{blue}P(B)} - {\\color{purple}P(A \\cap B)}$$\n:::\n\n## Example 2: Two dice\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"75%\"}\nConsider rolling two six-sided dice. Find the probability that their total is 8 or the\nsecond die shows a number greater or equal to 5.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"25%\"}\n![two dice](twodice.png)\n:::\n::::\n\n## Subtlety in Assumptions\n\nIn the previous example, we assumed a notion of **sampling with replacement**. That is, when rolling dice, we know that a number can be repeated. In other situations were observations cannot repeat, we are **sampling without replacement**.\n\n## Example 3: Faculty Matters\n\n:::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n### Prompt\n\nConsider a subset of the UC Merced Applied Math department with 6 faculty members—Blanchette, Buvoli, Sandoval, Stepanian, Thompson, Yatskar—must select two of its members to serve on a personnel review committee. Because the work will be time-consuming, no one is anxious to serve, so it is decided that the representatives will be selected by putting 6 slips of paper in a box, mixing them, and selecting two without replacement.\n\n- What is the probability that both Thompson and Yatskar will be selected?\n- What is the probability that at least one of the two members whose name begins with ‘B’ is selected?\n- If the 6 faculty members have taught for 15, 3, 5, 9, 4, and 12 years, respectively, at the university, what is the probability that the two chosen representatives have at least a combined 10 years’ teaching experience at the university?\n\n### Sample Space 1\n\n![](faculty1.png)\n\n### Sample Space 2\n\n![](faculty2.png)\n\n::::\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n\n- due Fri., Jan. 20:\n  - Perceptions of Probability (survey)\n  - WHW1\n- Identity Statement (essay)\n- and the before-lecture quizzes\t\n  \nExam 1 will be on Wed., Mar. 1\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n![](Super_Statistician.png)\n:::\n\n::::\n\n\n\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\t\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n:::\n\n::::\n",
