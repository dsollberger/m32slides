If you anticipate or experience physical or academic barriers based on a disability, please feel welcome to contact me privately so we can discuss options. In addition, please contact Student Accessibility Services (SAS) at (209) 228-6996 or disabilityservices@ucmerced.edu as soon as possible to explore reasonable accommodations. All accommodations must have prior approval from Student Accessibility Services on the basis of appropriate documentation. If you anticipate or experience barriers due to pregnancy, temporary medical condition, or injury,please feel welcome to contact me so we can discuss options. You are encouraged to contact the Dean of Students for support and resources at (209) 228-3633 or https://studentaffairs.ucmerced.edu/dean-students.\n\n## Academic Integrity\nAcademic integrity is the foundation of an academic community and without it none of the educational or research goals of the university can be achieved. All members of the community are responsible for its academic integrity. Existing policies forbid cheating on examinations, plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty. The UC Merced Academic Honesty Policy The UC\nMerced Academic Honesty Policy can be found on the Student Conduct website. Infractions against academic integrity will incur consequences such as an “F” on the assignment/exam and/or a report to the Academic Senate.\n\n\n## Nerdy Example\n\nHow many numbers between zero and one do we have to add up to have a sum that is greater than one?\n\n- Assume selection from a uniform distribution\n\n## Cumulative Summation\n\nLet us start with the natural numbers\n\n$$i = \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$$\nThen cumulative summation takes place with\n\n$$F(n) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} i$$\n\n## Cumulative Summation\n\nIn `R`, we can define a sequence of natural numbers\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnatural_numbers <- 1:10\nprint(natural_numbers)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nand then employ the `cumsum()` function to perform the cumulative summation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncumsum(natural_numbers)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1]  1  3  6 10 15 21 28 36 45 55\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Random Number Generation\n\nIn `R`, we generate a random number between zero and one (here: assumed from a uniform distribution) with the `runif` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrunif(1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.3763247\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom there, we can (for example) produce a **sample** of $n = 32$ such random numbers\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrunif(32)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] 0.808496253 0.530255245 0.575500263 0.925266754 0.218109261 0.948042712\n [7] 0.082536464 0.895080403 0.030557328 0.600224842 0.908927160 0.995998403\n[13] 0.506766883 0.232773983 0.097109339 0.935733052 0.008453035 0.821926254\n[19] 0.446838635 0.138450059 0.236597474 0.374993653 0.606477449 0.855093764\n[25] 0.869073509 0.978764013 0.936657508 0.248463629 0.316659372 0.007899186\n[31] 0.148523741 0.414026578\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## One Iteration\n\nNext, we employ function composition to apply cumulative summation to our vector of random numbers\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nX <- cumsum(runif(32))\nprint(X)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1]  0.7794607  1.1846579  2.1206889  3.0557736  3.3456139  3.9987518\n [7]  4.0430161  4.9879634  5.4354227  6.0101752  6.8707419  7.3198442\n[13]  7.6528439  8.3454212  8.3885242  9.1884093 10.0467503 10.9859400\n[19] 11.2546798 11.3066498 11.7020358 12.0357989 12.5634824 12.8123160\n[25] 12.8256348 12.9948029 13.3551376 13.6047064 13.7093181 13.9621456\n[31] 14.6875053 15.0901570\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nand then we can check when our cumulative summation first exceeded 1.0\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwhich.max(X > 1.0)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Simulation\n\nTo try to understand the randomness, we can repeat the procedure for many iterations (here, $N = 10000$).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nN <- 1e5 #number of iterations\nour_results <- rep(NA, N) #initialize space for results\nfor(i in 1:N){\n  this_vector <- cumsum(runif(10))\n  this_result <- which.max(this_vector > 1.0)\n  our_results[i] <- this_result\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Visualization\n\nTo understand a **distribution** of a probabilistic setting, we can visualize the results.\n\n:::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf <- data.frame(our_results)\ndf |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_histogram(aes(x = our_results), binwidth = 1,\n                 color = \"black\", fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Results\",\n       subtitle = \"How would you describe the distribution?\",\n       caption = \"Math 32\",\n       x = \"number of numbers needed\",\n       y = \"count\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2,8))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Graph\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Math_32_-_Introductions_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::::\n\n## Measure of Centrality\n\nTo hone in on our understanding of the distribution, let us take the `mean()` of `our_results`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(our_results, na.rm = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2.71241\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n- Note: `R` stops execution upon evaluating a missing value.
