If you anticipate or experience physical or academic barriers based on a disability, please feel welcome to contact me privately so we can discuss options. In addition, please contact Student Accessibility Services (SAS) at (209) 228-6996 or disabilityservices@ucmerced.edu as soon as possible to explore reasonable accommodations. All accommodations must have prior approval from Student Accessibility Services on the basis of appropriate documentation. If you anticipate or experience barriers due to pregnancy, temporary medical condition, or injury,please feel welcome to contact me so we can discuss options. You are encouraged to contact the Dean of Students for support and resources at (209) 228-3633 or https://studentaffairs.ucmerced.edu/dean-students.\n\n## Academic Integrity\nAcademic integrity is the foundation of an academic community and without it none of the educational or research goals of the university can be achieved. All members of the community are responsible for its academic integrity. Existing policies forbid cheating on examinations, plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty. The UC Merced Academic Honesty Policy The UC\nMerced Academic Honesty Policy can be found on the Student Conduct website. Infractions against academic integrity will incur consequences such as an “F” on the assignment/exam and/or a report to the Academic Senate.\n\n\n## Nerdy Example\n\nHow many numbers between zero and one do we have to add up to have a sum that is greater than one?\n\n- Assume selection from a uniform distribution\n\n## Cumulative Summation\n\nLet us start with the natural numbers\n\n\n$$i = \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$$\n\nThen cumulative summation takes place with\n\n\n$$F(n) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} i$$\n\n\n## Cumulative Summation\n\nIn `R`, we can define a sequence of natural numbers\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnatural_numbers <- 1:10\nprint(natural_numbers)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nand then employ the `cumsum()` function to perform the cumulative summation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncumsum(natural_numbers)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1]  1  3  6 10 15 21 28 36 45 55\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Random Number Generation\n\nIn `R`, we generate a random number between zero and one (here: assumed from a uniform distribution) with the `runif` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrunif(1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.81505\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom there, we can (for example) produce a **sample** of $n = 32$ such random numbers\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrunif(32)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] 0.23201307 0.87127077 0.70026832 0.87895876 0.87331526 0.05036756\n [7] 0.70975768 0.04589654 0.81148165 0.67277373 0.36444518 0.05252578\n[13] 0.93071222 0.65069917 0.63382323 0.50296153 0.74808861 0.93567290\n[19] 0.21726304 0.03206728 0.93737557 0.21783477 0.90292332 0.21608644\n[25] 0.31198929 0.27790058 0.42172615 0.43130608 0.20329206 0.94117982\n[31] 0.95907322 0.59290890\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## One Iteration\n\nNext, we employ function composition to apply cumulative summation to our vector of random numbers\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nX <- cumsum(runif(32))\nprint(X)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1]  0.2451511  0.5850619  1.2441624  2.0179309  2.5838395  2.9461865\n [7]  3.1303979  3.8536004  4.5735742  4.6358679  4.8938637  5.6998413\n[13]  6.3232469  7.0119696  7.9724195  8.2188149  8.7869916  9.1473904\n[19]  9.8618203 10.3766007 11.3126492 11.9842738 12.1088123 12.6723460\n[25] 13.6674356 14.3986901 15.0511902 15.1968950 16.1945759 16.9695972\n[31] 17.9123227 17.9644575\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nand then we can check when our cumulative summation first exceeded 1.0\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwhich.max(X > 1.0)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 3\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Simulation\n\nTo try to understand the randomness, we can repeat the procedure for many iterations (here, $N = 10000$).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nN <- 1e5 #number of iterations\nour_results <- rep(NA, N) #initialize space for results\nfor(i in 1:N){\n  this_vector <- cumsum(runif(10))\n  this_result <- which.max(this_vector > 1.0)\n  our_results[i] <- this_result\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Visualization\n\nTo understand a **distribution** of a probabilistic setting, we can visualize the results.\n\n:::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf <- data.frame(our_results)\ndf |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_histogram(aes(x = our_results), binwidth = 1,\n                 color = \"black\", fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Results\",\n       subtitle = \"How would you describe the distribution?\",\n       caption = \"Math 32\",\n       x = \"number of numbers needed\",\n       y = \"count\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2,8))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Graph\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Math_32_-_Introductions_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::::\n\n## Measure of Centrality\n\nTo hone in on our understanding of the distribution, let us take the `mean()` of `our_results`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(our_results, na.rm = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2.71847\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n- Note: `R` stops execution upon evaluating a missing value.
