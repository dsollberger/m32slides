In this section, we discuss how to properly think and calculate that inverse probability.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\nAnother look at conditional probability is\n$$P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)$$\nThis is read as \"The probability of the intersection $A$ and $B$ is the probability of event $B$ *conditioned* on event $A$.\"\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\nMoreover, if we consider how if event $B$ is dependent on event $A$, then sometimes $B$ happens when $A$ happens and sometimes when $A$ does not occur.  More succinctly, the *total probability* of event $B$ is\n$$P(B) = P(B|A) \\cdot P(A) + P(B|A^{c}) \\cdot P(A^{c})$$ \n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nStaring with the conditional probability formula\n$$P(B|A) = \\ds\\frac{P(A \\text{ and } B)}{P(A)}$$\n*Bayes' Rule* combines the ideas of conditioned probability and total probability as\n$$P(A|B) = \\ds\\frac{P(A \\text{ and } B)}{P(B)} = \\ds\\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A) + P(B|A^{c}) \\cdot P(A^{c})}$$\n:::\n\n## A Deep Dive\n\n:::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Example\n\nAn executive has their blood tested for boneitis.  Let $B$ be the event that an executive has the disease, and let $T$ be the event that the test returns positive.  Laboratory trials yielded the following information:\n\n$$P(T|B) = 0.70 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad P(T|B^{c}) = 0.10$$\n\nAssume a prior probability of $P(B) = 0.0032$.
