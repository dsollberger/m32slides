The probability of choosing $k$ observations among a sample size of $n$, each observation with prior probability $p$, is given by\n\n\n\n$$P(k) = \\binom{n}{k}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}$$\n\n\n\nNote the usual properties of probability:\n\n- each probability is between zero and one (inclusively)\n    \n\n$$0 \\leq P(k) \\leq 1 \\quad\\text{for each } k$$\n\n- all probabilities add up to 100\\%\n    \n \n\n$$1 = \\ds\\sum_{k = 0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}$$\n\n\n## From One to Many\n\n:::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Exactly\n\nThere are 4 parking spaces in front of the boba place.
