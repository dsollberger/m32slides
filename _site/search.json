    "text": "Example: Boxing Bets\n\n\nBefore watching a boxing match, my friends and I made bets over which round the fight would end. A boxing match lasts up to 12 rounds. Each gambler pays $5 and is assigned a round randomly. The winner garners the whole pot of money. What is the expected value of the bet? What is the variance of the bet?"
