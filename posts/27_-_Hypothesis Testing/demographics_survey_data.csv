Moon Knight is cool","Funny Valentine from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 7: Steel Ball Run is a pretty well written villain. The lowest form of written villain are villains who are just evil for the sake of being evil or for powerlust, but Funny Valentine rises to the highest and most complex villain, whose motives are hard to find fault in and arguably better than the protagonist's.

I grew up watching him ever since I was little through the cartoons and the Sam Raimi movies. Plus, the many different Spider-Man from the multiverse are so cool and interesting with 2099, Noir, and many others.

I would have said Daredevil since I also like him a lot as well since he even had a cartoon special with Spider-Man and has his own series. However, I've spent my childhood with Spider-Man for the most part.

An honorable mention would be Batman from DC since I enjoyed The Batman animated series a lot as well alongside his Dark Knight movies.

 ",My favorite super-villain has to be Mysterio from Marvel. I enjoy his character design and his techniques to confuse his opponent as he does with Spider-Man in the comics and as he did in his first live-action movie appearance in Spider-Man Far From Home.,Spring,right-handed,80,60,8,75,My favorite class so far at UC Merced has to be PHIL 002 which was Introduction to Ethics class. I have enjoyed all my Chem and Math classes as well but they did not stand out as much in comparison to this class. I enjoyed the philosophical studies and books we read about different ethical views.,"My favorite professor has to be Tommasso Buvoli from my Math 22 class.

My favorite TA has to be Randy Espinoza from one of my previous Chemistry classes.",snow,chicken nuggets,85

But for the MCU I can say that hands down my favorite villain was either Baron Von Zemo, Thanos, or Winter Soldier. Thanos for his unforgettable and absolutely chilling quotes and Zemo for being the only villain to truly defeat the Avengers without ever coming into physical contact with them. Zemo did the impossible and his approach was heartbreaking and somber. Winter Soldier was in the greatest superhero movie to ever be created and is still the most badass and paralyzing ever single time he stepped onto the big screen, the score, the stare, his walk, everything about his presence was very heavy and it is awesome.",Winter,right-handed,90,70,4,70,ME-137 Solidworks.

Michelle was always super helpful and actually sat down with you to get your brain thinking in the right direction and always made sure that you understood everything.

Kamal was one of my first TAs and although soft spoken was always very kind and made the classroom a very warm and welcoming environment to learn and think outloud

Matteo was the hardest on me but it was tough love, with a bad first impression of being on my phone while he was talking I eventually came around to being his go to within the class. I tried really hard to understand an visualize everything and he understood that and was always pushing me harder to comprehend. Very good TA",ocean,chicken tenders,90
