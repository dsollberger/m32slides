## Continuous Variables

![Image Credit: G2 Learing Hub](discrete vs continuous.png)

- A discrete variable is “countable” (has values that can be in a list)
- A continuous variable has values that cannot be written as a list (“uncountable”)

## Uniform Distribution

![](Cattracks1.png)

You arrive at a bus stop at 10 o'clock, knowing that the bus will arrive at some time uniformly distributed between 10:00 and 10:30.

## Normalization

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
We build a **probability density function** (PDF) by ensuring that the area under the curve equals 100 percent (i.e. one square unit).

If at 10:15 the bus has not yet arrived, what is the probability that you will have to wait at least an additional 10 minutes?

## Linear Distribution

![](Cattracks2.png)

You arrive at a bus stop at 10 o'clock, knowing that the bus will arrive at some time linearly distributed between 10:00 and 10:30.  The probability density function (PDF) is

$$f(x) = \begin{cases} -\ds\frac{1}{450}x + \ds\frac{1}{15} & 0 \leq x \leq 30 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

## Cumulative Density Function

- There are no nonzero probabilities to the left.  The CDF "starts with zero" probability.  Here, $F(0) = 0$
- Since all probabilities add up to 100\%, the CDF 
ends at one".  Here, $F(30) = 1$

  - WHW5
  - LHW5
  - Mid-Semester Survey
  
- Exam 2 will be on Tues., Nov. 1
