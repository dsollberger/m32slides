## Example: Subsetting

Consider the months of the year

$$M = \{\text{Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec} \}$$
Let us say that a month is ``long'' if it has 31 days.  What is the probability that we have a long month given that we are in the Fall semester?

$$F = \{ \text{Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec} \}$$
## Conditional Probability

We can condense this process into a formula for conditional probability:

:::{.callout-note}
The **conditional probability** of observing event $A$ *given* event $B$ has already taken place is

$$P(A|B) = \ds\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$
:::

## Example: Contigency Tables

In this hypothetical example, suppose that we are following an epidemiologist who is testing patients at a hospital in for the novel strain of coronavirus.

(A) Build a contingency table with the following data

- 175 true positives
- 32 false negatives
- 18 false positives
- 2019 true negatives

(B) Compute the probability that a randomly selected patient is disease free given that the drug test is positive.

## Prosecutor's Fallacy

(C) Using the same counts as the previous example, compute the probability that for a randomly selected patient the test returns positive given that the patient is disease free.

:::{.callout-warning}
Converses for conditional probability are almost never equal.

$$P(A|B) \neq P(B|A)$$
:::

## Bayes' Rule

In the previous section, we studied conditional probability
$$P(B|A) = \ds\frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(A)}$$
and we talked about how the inverse probabilities $P(A|B)$ and $P(B|A)$ are almost never equal.  In this section, we discuss how to properly think and calculate that inverse probability.

:::{.callout-tip}
Another look at conditional probability is
$$P(A \text{ and } B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A)$$
This is read as "The probability of the intersection $A$ and $B$ is the probability of event $B$ *conditioned* on event $A$."
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
Moreover, if we consider how if event $B$ is dependent on event $A$, then sometimes $B$ happens when $A$ happens and sometimes when $A$ does not occur.  More succinctly, the *total probability* of event $B$ is
$$P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^{c}) \cdot P(A^{c})$$ 
:::

:::{.callout-note}
Staring with the conditional probability formula
$$P(B|A) = \ds\frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(A)}$$
*Bayes' Rule* combines the ideas of conditioned probability and total probability as
$$P(A|B) = \ds\frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)} = \ds\frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^{c}) \cdot P(A^{c})}$$

## A Deep Dive

:::: {.panel-tabset}

## Example

An executive has their blood tested for boneitis.  Let $B$ be the event that an executive has the disease, and let $T$ be the event that the test returns positive.  Laboratory trials yielded the following information:

$$P(T|B) = 0.70 \quad\text{and}\quad P(T|B^{c}) = 0.10$$

Assume a prior probability of $P(B) = 0.0032$.  Compute $P(B|T)$
