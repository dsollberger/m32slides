## Dependence

Goal: Start to consider dependence in probability

Objective: Practice conditional probability calculations

## Example: Subsetting

Consider the months of the year

$$M = \{\text{Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec} \}$$
Let us say that a month is ``long'' if it has 31 days.  What is the probability that we have a long month given that we are in the Spring semester?

$$S = \{ \text{Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May} \}$$

## Conditional Probability

We can condense this process into a formula for conditional probability:

:::{.callout-note}
## Conditional Probability

The **conditional probability** of observing event $A$ *given* event $B$ has already taken place is

$$P(A|B) = \ds\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$
:::

## Example: Contigency Tables

In this hypothetical example, suppose that we are following an epidemiologist who is testing patients at a hospital in for the novel strain of coronavirus.

(A) Build a contingency table with the following data

- 175 true positives
- 32 false negatives
- 18 false positives
- 2019 true negatives

(B) Compute the probability that a randomly selected patient is disease free given that the drug test is positive.

## Prosecutor's Fallacy

(C) Using the same counts as the previous example, compute the probability that for a randomly selected patient the test returns positive given that the patient is disease free.

:::{.callout-warning collapse="true"}
Converses for conditional probability are almost never equal.

$$P(A|B) \neq P(B|A)$$
:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
What do we do when the order of the events switch?
