## Assuming a Distribution

Unless otherwise noted, the coin flip has two disjoint outcomes---`heads` or `tails`---with probabilities

$$P(\text{heads}) = 0.5, \quad P(\text{tails}) = 0.5$$

In the early formation of the field of statistics, there were considerations such as the following.  How should the possibility space for a trial of flipping two coins be represented?

- 3 elements: $\{$two heads, mixed result, two tails$\}$, OR
- 4 elements: $\{$HH, HT, TH, TT$\}$

## Complements

:::{.callout-note}
To sets are **disjoint** if
$$P(A \cap B) = 0$$
:::

:::{.callout-note}
A **possibility space** is a set of all of the possible outcomes for an event.  It is usually denoted by the Greek letter capital omega.
:::

For example, the set of all outcomes for two coin flips of a fair coin turns out to be

$$\Omega = \{HH, HT, TH, TT\}$$

:::{.callout-note}
If $A$ is a set (and a subset of the possibility space), then the **complement** of A, denoted $A^{c}$, is the set of outcomes that is in the universal set but not in the set A

$$A \subseteq \Omega \quad\Rightarrow\quad A^{c} = \Omega - A$$

## Example 4: One Die

For example, if we think of our roll of a six-sided die, the possibility space was
$$\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$$
If we have a subset consisting of the even numbers 
$$E = \{2, 4, 6\}$$
what do you think the complement $E^{c}$ will be?

## Empty Set

:::{.callout-note}
The empty set $\{\}$ literally has zero elements in the set
:::

**Claim**: Set $A$ and its complement are disjoint.

## Example 5: Replacement

There may be situations where we need to be careful about whether selections from a set were done **with replacement** or **without replacement**.

In the wardrobe, there are 8 blue socks and 6 red socks.

$$B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B$$
$$R, R, R, R, R, R$$

Compute the following probabilities

- Selecting 3 red socks with replacement
- Selecting 3 red socks without replacement
- Selecting 4 blue socks with replacement
- Selecting 4 blue socks without replacement

:::{.callout-tip}
Notice how when we sample with replacement, each iteration is **independent** of the previous iterations.  When we sample without replacement, each iteration **depends** on the previous iterations.
:::

## De Morgan's Law

One relationship between the notions of complements, intersections, and unions is as follows.

:::{.callout-note}
$$(A \cup B)^{c} = A^{c} \cap B^{c}$$
The complement of the union is the intersection of the complements.
