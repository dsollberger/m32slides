## Starter Examples

In order to introduce probability concepts, you will notice that many sections of this
book start out by talking about simple situations such as flipping a coin or rolling a die (or
rolling a pair of dice). This is to ease the reader into more complicated examples.

:::{.callout-note}
A **possibility space** is a set of all of the possible outcomes.
:::

## Example 1: One Die

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
Consider rolling one six-sided die. For each of the following events, list their possible ways, and then find their probabilities:

- A: rolling an even number
- B: rolling a number greater than 3
- C: rolling a double-digit number
:::

## Starting to Combine

At first, we consider simply adding up the probabilities to compute the probability of the union of the probabilities:

$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) = ?$$
## Inconsistent?

So far, 

$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) = 100\%$$
What went wrong? (Discuss with a neighbor)

## Some Set Notation

:::{.callout-tip}
The **union** of sets A and B is the set of all elements that appear either in set A OR set B
$$A \cup B = \{x : x \in A \text{ OR } x \in B\}$$
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
The **intersection** of sets A and B is the set of all elements that appear both in set A AND set B
$$A \cap B = \{x : x \in A \text{ AND } x \in B\}$$
:::

## Inclusion-Exclusion Principle

We observe that there was an *overlap* in the calculation.  Since some elements were counted twice, we can compensate by subtracting one copy of that overlap.  This notion is called the **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**

:::{.callout-note}
To compute the probability of a set union, we need to consider the overlapping portions.  For two sets A and B, the probability of observing the union is
$$P(A \cup B) = {\color{red}P(A)} + {\color{blue}P(B)} - {\color{purple}P(A \cap B)}$$
:::

## Example 2: Two dice

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
Consider rolling two six-sided dice. Find the probability that their total is 8 or the
second die shows a number greater or equal to 5.
:::

## Subtlety in Assumptions

In the previous example, we assumed a notion of **sampling with replacement**. That is, when rolling dice, we know that a number can be repeated. In other situations were observations cannot repeat, we are **sampling without replacement**.

## Example 3: Faculty Matters

:::: {.panel-tabset}

### Prompt

Consider a subset of the UC Merced Applied Math department with 6 faculty members—Blanchette, Buvoli, Sandoval, Stepanian, Thompson, Yatskar—must select two of its members to serve on a personnel review committee. Because the work will be time-consuming, no one is anxious to serve, so it is decided that the representatives will be selected by putting 6 slips of paper in a box, mixing them, and selecting two without replacement.

- What is the probability that both Thompson and Yatskar will be selected?
- What is the probability that at least one of the two members whose name begins with ‘B’ is selected?
- If the 6 faculty members have taught for 15, 3, 5, 9, 4, and 12 years, respectively, at the university, what is the probability that the two chosen representatives have at least a combined 10 years’ teaching experience at the university?

## Assuming a Distribution

Unless otherwise noted, the coin flip has two disjoint outcomes---`heads` or `tails`---with probabilities

$$P(\text{heads}) = 0.5, \quad P(\text{tails}) = 0.5$$
![](twocoins.png)

In the early formation of the field of statistics, there were considerations such as the following.  How should the possibility space for a trial of flipping two coins be represented?

- 3 elements: $\{$two heads, mixed result, two tails$\}$, OR
- 4 elements: $\{$HH, HT, TH, TT$\}$

## Complements

:::{.callout-note}
To sets are **disjoint** if
$$P(A \cap B) = 0$$
:::

:::{.callout-note}
A **possibility space** is a set of all of the possible outcomes for an event.  It is usually denoted by the Greek letter capital omega.
:::

For example, the set of all outcomes for two coin flips of a fair coin turns out to be

$$\Omega = \{HH, HT, TH, TT\}$$

:::{.callout-note}
If $A$ is a set (and a subset of the possibility space), then the **complement** of A, denoted $A^{c}$, is the set of outcomes that is in the universal set but not in the set A

$$A \subseteq \Omega \quad\Rightarrow\quad A^{c} = \Omega - A$$
:::

## Example 4: One Die

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="25%"}
![](die.png)	
:::

::: {.column width="75%"}
For example, if we think of our roll of a six-sided die, the possibility space was
$$\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$$
If we have a subset consisting of the even numbers 
$$E = \{2, 4, 6\}$$
what do you think the complement $E^{c}$ will be?
:::

::::

## Empty Set

:::{.callout-note}
The empty set $\{\}$ literally has zero elements in the set
:::

**Claim**: Set $A$ and its complement are disjoint.

## Example 5: Replacement

There may be situations where we need to be careful about whether selections from a set were done **with replacement** or **without replacement**.

In the wardrobe, there are 8 blue socks and 6 red socks.

$$B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B$$
$$R, R, R, R, R, R$$

Compute the following probabilities

- Selecting 3 red socks with replacement
- Selecting 3 red socks without replacement
- Selecting 4 blue socks with replacement
- Selecting 4 blue socks without replacement

:::{.callout-tip}
Notice how when we sample with replacement, each iteration is **independent** of the previous iterations.  When we sample without replacement, each iteration **depends** on the previous iterations.
:::

## De Morgan's Law

One relationship between the notions of complements, intersections, and unions is as follows.

:::{.callout-note}
$$(A \cup B)^{c} = A^{c} \cap B^{c}$$
The complement of the union is the intersection of the complements.
