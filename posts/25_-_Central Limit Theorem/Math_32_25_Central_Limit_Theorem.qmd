## Today: Central Limit Theorem

**Goal**: Consolidate our understanding of variance

**Objectives**:  Update our understanding of the normal distribution


## Bringing it all Together

## Linear Operators

Recall, from our studies into linear operators,

-  $\text{E}[aX + bY + c] = a\text{E}[X] + b\text{E}[Y] + c$
- $\text{Var}[aX + bY + c] = a^{2}\text{Var}[X] + b^{2}\text{Var}[Y] + 2ab\text{Cov}(X,Y)$

Let $X_{i}$ be a set of $n$ i.i.d. random variables from the same distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^{2}$.  By induction, we can extrapolate these results for summations:

- $\text{E}\left[ \ds\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{i} \right] = \ds\sum_{i=1}^{n}\text{E}\left[  X_{i} \right] = n\mu$
- $\text{Var}\left[ \ds\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{i} \right] = \ds\sum_{i=1}^{n}\text{Var}\left[  X_{i} \right] = n\sigma^{2}$

Recall, independence implies zero covariance.

## Law of Large Numbers

Recall, from our look at the Law of Large Numbers, for the sample mean of random variables $\bar{X}_{n}$,

- $\text{E}[\bar{X}_{n}] = \mu$ 
- $\text{Var}(\bar{X}_{n}) = \ds\frac{\sigma^{2}}{n}$

## Estimators

Finally, 

- sample mean $\bar{X}_{n}$ is an unbiased estimator of population mean $\mu$
- sample variance $S_{n}^{2}$ is an unbiased estimator of population variance $\sigma^{2}$

and the sample standard deviation $s$ is **almost** an unbiased estimator of the population standard deviation $\sigma$

## Summation

## Larger Variance

Following from how $\text{Var}\left[ \ds\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{i} \right] =  n\sigma^{2}$, it follows that the standard deviation for a summation is
$$\sigma_{n} = \sigma\sqrt{n}$$

Think: as sample size $n$ increases, does $\sigma_{n}$ increase or decrease?

$$z\text{-score:} \quad z = \ds\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \quad\rightarrow\quad Z_{n} = \ds\frac{\sum X_{i} - \text{E}\left[ \ds\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{i} \right]}{\sigma_{n}} = \ds\frac{\sum X_{i} - n\mu}{\sigma\sqrt{n}}$$

## Example

For Covid-19, the population statistics for sick patients are a mean of $\mu = 4$ days and standard deviation $\sigma = 2$ days (assuming a normal distribution since the number of confirmed cases is numerous).  For an incoming case load of 9 sick patients, what is the probability that they need at least 32 days **combined** in the hospital?

## Smaller Variance

Following from how $\text{Var}\left[ \bar{X}_{n} \right] =  \ds\frac{\sigma^{2}}{n}$, it follows that the standard deviation for an average is
$$\sigma_{n} = \ds\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$

- This $\ds\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ is also called the *standard error*.

Think: as sample size $n$ increases, does $\sigma_{n}$ increase or decrease?

$$z\text{-score:} \quad z = \ds\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \quad\rightarrow\quad Z_{n} = \ds\frac{\bar{X}_{n} - \text{E}[\bar{X}_{n}]}{\sigma_{n}} = \ds\frac{\bar{X}_{n} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}$$

## Example

For Covid-19, the population statistics for the incubation period are a mean of $\mu = 8$ days and standard deviation $\sigma = 3$ days (assuming a normal distribution since the number of confirmed cases is numerous).  For a sample of 25 infected people, what is the probability that their **average** incubation period is fewer than 7 days?
