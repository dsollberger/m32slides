## Example: Demographics

![](ucmstudents.png)

Suppose that all of the students in Math 32 are between ages 19 and 21 inclusively with the following distribution:

- Age 19: 35\%
- Age 20: 45\%
- Age 21: 20\%

Rewrite the data as a discrete mass function.

## Discrete Probability Distributions

:::{.callout-note}
A **discrete probability distribution** is a population where we can *list* the possible values

$$X = \{ x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, ... x_{n} \}$$

and measure the respective probabilities

$$P(X = x_{1}), P(X = x_{2}), P(X = x_{3}), ..., P(X = x_{n})$$
:::

:::{.callout-tip}

As usual, the probabilities rules include that each probability is between zero and one inclusively

$$0 \leq P(X = x_{i}) \leq 1$$

and that all probabilities add up to 100 percent

$$\ds\sum_{x \in X} P(X = x) = 1$$
:::

## Expectation

:::{.callout-note}
For a *random variable* $X$ (understood through a discrete probability distribution), its **expected value** is
$$\mu = \text{E}[{\color{blue}X}] = \ds\sum_{x \in X} {\color{blue}x} \cdot {\color{red}P(X = x)}$$

Compute the expected value of the roll of one six-sided die.

## Variance

:::{.callout-note}
The **variance** of a random variable $X$ is defined as the expected squared deviation from the mean

$$\text{Var}(X) = \text{E}[(X - \text{E}[X])^{2}]$$
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
The above *theoretical formula* is built from first principles and is good for building the math foundation.  However, the following *practical formula* is better for hand calculations and computer calculations.
:::

**Claim:** 

$$\text{Var}(X) = \text{E}[X^{2}] - \left(\text{E}[X]\right)^{2}$$

## Example: Boxing Bets

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
Before watching a boxing match, my friends and I made bets over which round the fight would end.  A boxing match lasts up to 12 rounds.  Each gambler pays \$5 and is assigned a round randomly.  The winner garners the whole pot of money.  What is the expected value of the bet?  What is the variance of the bet?
