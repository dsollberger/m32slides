## Starter Examples

In order to introduce probability concepts, you will notice that many sections of this
book start out by talking about simple situations such as flipping a coin or rolling a die (or
rolling a pair of dice). This is to ease the reader into more complicated examples.

:::{.callout-note}
A **possibility space** is a set of all of the possible outcomes.

## Example 1: One Die

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
Consider rolling one six-sided die. For each of the following events, list their possible ways, and then find their probabilities:

- A: rolling an even number
- B: rolling a number greater than 3
- C: rolling a double-digit number

## Starting to Combine

At first, we consider simply adding up the probabilities to compute the probability of the union of the probabilities:

$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) = ?$$
## Inconsistent?

So far, 

$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) = 100\%$$
What went wrong? (Discuss with a neighbor)

## Some Set Notation

:::{.callout-tip}
The **union** of sets A and B is the set of all elements that appear either in set A OR set B
$$A \cup B = \{x : x \in A \text{ OR } x \in B\}$$
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
The **intersection** of sets A and B is the set of all elements that appear both in set A AND set B
$$A \cap B = \{x : x \in A \text{ AND } x \in B\}$$
:::

## Inclusion-Exclusion Principle

We observe that there was an *overlap* in the calculation.  Since some elements were counted twice, we can compensate by subtracting one copy of that overlap.  This notion is called the **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**

:::{.callout-note}
To compute the probability of a set union, we need to consider the overlapping portions.  For two sets A and B, the probability of observing the union is
$$P(A \cup B) = {\color{red}P(A)} + {\color{blue}P(B)} - {\color{purple}P(A \cap B)}$$
:::

## Example 2: Two dice

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
Consider rolling two six-sided dice. Find the probability that their total is 8 or the
second die shows a number greater or equal to 5.

## Subtlety in Assumptions

In the previous example, we assumed a notion of **sampling with replacement**. That is, when rolling dice, we know that a number can be repeated. In other situations were observations cannot repeat, we are **sampling without replacement**.

## Example 3: Faculty Matters

:::: {.panel-tabset}

### Prompt

Consider a subset of the UC Merced Applied Math department with 6 faculty members—Blanchette, Buvoli, Sandoval, Stepanian, Thompson, Yatskar—must select two of its members to serve on a personnel review committee. Because the work will be time-consuming, no one is anxious to serve, so it is decided that the representatives will be selected by putting 6 slips of paper in a box, mixing them, and selecting two without replacement.

- What is the probability that both Thompson and Yatskar will be selected?
- What is the probability that at least one of the two members whose name begins with ‘B’ is selected?
- If the 6 faculty members have taught for 15, 3, 5, 9, 4, and 12 years, respectively, at the university, what is the probability that the two chosen representatives have at least a combined 10 years’ teaching experience at the university?
