## Why Probability?

### The Classic Birthday Problem

How many students have to enter the classroom until there are two students that share a birthday?

## Deterministic vs Probabilistic

Deterministic:  a situation that can be solved with equation solving and/or an algorithm

- Example:  If water boils at 100 degrees Celsius, what is that threshold in Fahrenheit?

Probabilistic: a situation that cannot be completely solved due to an element of chance

- Example:  What is the chance that it will rain tomorrow?

## Student Accessibility Services


Special Accommodations: University of California, Merced is committed to creating learning environments that are accessible to all. If you anticipate or experience physical or academic barriers based on a disability, please feel welcome to contact me privately so we can discuss options. In addition, please contact Student Accessibility Services (SAS) at (209) 228-6996 or disabilityservices@ucmerced.edu as soon as possible to explore reasonable accommodations. All accommodations must have prior approval from Student Accessibility Services on the basis of appropriate documentation. If you anticipate or experience barriers due to pregnancy, temporary medical condition, or injury,please feel welcome to contact me so we can discuss options. You are encouraged to contact the Dean of Students for support and resources at (209) 228-3633 or https://studentaffairs.ucmerced.edu/dean-students.

## Academic Integrity
Academic integrity is the foundation of an academic community and without it none of the educational or research goals of the university can be achieved. All members of the community are responsible for its academic integrity. Existing policies forbid cheating on examinations, plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty. The UC Merced Academic Honesty Policy The UC
Merced Academic Honesty Policy can be found on the Student Conduct website. Infractions against academic integrity will incur consequences such as an “F” on the assignment/exam and/or a report to the Academic Senate.


## Nerdy Example

How many numbers between zero and one do we have to add up to have a sum that is greater than one?

- Assume selection from a uniform distribution

## Cumulative Summation

Let us start with the natural numbers

$$i = \{1, 2, 3, ...\}$$
Then cumulative summation takes place with

$$F(n) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} i$$

## Cumulative Summation

In `R`, we can define a sequence of natural numbers

```{r}
#| echo: true
natural_numbers <- 1:10
print(natural_numbers)
```

and then employ the `cumsum()` function to perform the cumulative summation.

```{r}
#| echo: true
cumsum(natural_numbers)
```

## Random Number Generation

In `R`, we generate a random number between zero and one (here: assumed from a uniform distribution) with the `runif` function.

```{r}
#| echo: true
runif(1)
```

From there, we can (for example) produce a **sample** of $n = 32$ such random numbers

```{r}
#| echo: true
runif(32)
```

## One Iteration

Next, we employ function composition to apply cumulative summation to our vector of random numbers

```{r}
#| echo: true
X <- cumsum(runif(32))
print(X)
```

and then we can check when our cumulative summation first exceeded 1.0

```{r}
#| echo: true
which.max(X > 1.0)
```

## Simulation

To try to understand the randomness, we can repeat the procedure for many iterations (here, $N = 10000$).

```{r}
#| echo: true

N <- 1e5 #number of iterations
our_results <- rep(NA, N) #initialize space for results
for(i in 1:N){
  this_vector <- cumsum(runif(10))
  this_result <- which.max(this_vector > 1.0)
  our_results[i] <- this_result
}
```

## Visualization

To understand a **distribution** of a probabilistic setting, we can visualize the results.

:::: {.panel-tabset}

## Code

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

df <- data.frame(our_results)
df |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = our_results), binwidth = 1,
                 color = "black", fill = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Results",
       subtitle = "How would you describe the distribution?",
       caption = "Math 32",
       x = "number of numbers needed",
       y = "count") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2,8))
```

## Graph

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

df <- data.frame(our_results)
df |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = our_results), binwidth = 1,
                 color = "black", fill = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Results",
       subtitle = "How would you describe the distribution?",
       caption = "Math 32",
       x = "number of numbers needed",
       y = "count") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2,8))
```

::::

## Measure of Centrality

To hone in on our understanding of the distribution, let us take the `mean()` of `our_results`

```{r}
#| echo: true
mean(our_results, na.rm = TRUE)
```

- Note: `R` stops execution upon evaluating a missing value.  For our intents and purposes, we will suppress that exception with `na.rm = TRUE`

## Nerdy Example

How many numbers between zero and one do we have to add up to have a sum that is greater than one?

$$ e \approx 2.718282$$

```{r}
#| echo: true

# theoretical answer
exp(1)
```

Thought questions:

- how do we know that the answer converges?
- how many iterations did we need for a sufficient answer?
