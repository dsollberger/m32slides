## Overview

$$s^{2} = \ds\frac{1}{n-1}\ds\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (x_{i} - \bar{x})^{2}$$


Today's main questions are "What is variance and what is a standard deviation?"  We will go through

- the formulas and calculations
- demostrations
- applications (word problems)

## Notation

We tend to study a relatively small *sample* to understand the behavior of a much larger *population*.

## Example: Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
Each year on July 4, the Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest takes place on Coney Island in New York.  The rule is simple: eat as many hot dogs (and buns) as you can in 10 minutes.  The past 5 winning amounts were:  63, 70, 72, 74, 71.  Compute the variance.	

$$s^{2} = \ds\frac{1}{n-1}\ds\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (x_{i} - \bar{x})^{2}$$

## Units?

## Demostrations

## Setup

For each of the following sets

- $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$
- $B = \{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$
- $C = \{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\}$
- $D = \{-9, -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, 9\}$

we will compute the sample mean, sample median, and sample standard deviation.

## R

```{r}
A <- seq(1, 7, 1)
B <- A + 2
C <- seq(-3, 3, 3)
D <- 3*C
```

## A to B

```{r}
mean(A)
mean(B)
```

```{r}
median(A)
median(B)
```

```{r}
sd(A)
sd(B)
```

## C to D

```{r}
mean(C)
mean(D)
```

```{r}
median(C)
median(D)
```

```{r}
sd(C)
sd(D)
```

## Standardization

$$z = \ds\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$

To standardize data, compute a z-score by

- subtracting by the mean
- then dividing by the standard deviation

This calculation is considered to be “unitless”, and the units are usually said as “[number of] standard deviations above/below the mean”

Most data falls within two standard deviations of the mean, 

$$\text{usually } z \in (-2, 2)$$

but $z \in (-\infty, \infty)$


## Example: Dating Website Data

:::: {.panel-tabset}

## Scenario 1

![](howMenRateWomen.png)

According to OkCupid data, if men rate women on a scale from 1 = “least attractive” to 7 = “most attractive”, the average score is 3.99 with a sample standard deviation of 1.6401.

- What is the $z$-score of a woman rated a "6"?
- What is the attractiveness score of a woman at a $z$-score of 1.5?

## Scenario 2

![](howWomenRateMen.png)

According to OkCupid data, if women rate men on a scale from 1 = “least attractive” to 7 = “most attractive”, the average score is 2.43 with a sample standard deviation of 1.2510.

- What is the $z$-score of a man rated a "6"?
- What is the attractiveness score of a man at a $z$-score of 1.5?
