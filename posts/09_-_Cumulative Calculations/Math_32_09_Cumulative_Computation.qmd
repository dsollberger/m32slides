## Probability Mass Function

Last time, we developed the *probability mass function* for the binomial distribution.  The probability of choosing $k$ observations among a sample size of $n$, each observation with prior probability $p$, is given by


$$P(k) = \binom{n}{k}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}$$


Note the usual properties of probability:

- each probability is between zero and one (inclusively)
    
$$0 \leq P(k) \leq 1 \quad\text{for each } k$$
- all probabilities add up to 100\%
    
 
$$1 = \ds\sum_{k = 0}^{n} \binom{n}{k}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}$$

## From One to Many

## Exactly

There are 4 parking spaces in front of the boba place.  Suppose that each parking space tends to be occupied about 57 percent of the time.  What is the probability that *exactly 3* of the parking spaces are open?

## At Most

There are 4 parking spaces in front of the boba place.  Suppose that each parking space tends to be occupied about 57 percent of the time.  What is the probability that *at most 2* of the parking spaces are open?

## Exactly

There are 32 parking spaces in a row in a UC Merced parking lot.  Suppose that each parking space tends to be occupied about 81 percent of the time.  What is the probability that *exactly 4* of the parking spaces are open?

## More Than

There are 32 parking spaces in a row in a UC Merced parking lot.  Suppose that each parking space tends to be occupied about 81 percent of the time.  What is the probability that *more than 5* of the parking spaces are open?

## Leveraging Complements

There are 32 parking spaces in a row in a UC Merced parking lot.  Suppose that each parking space tends to be occupied about 97 percent of the time.  What is the probability that **at least one** of the parking spaces is open?
