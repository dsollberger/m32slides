## Example: Spam Filtering

In 2002, Paul Graham used Bayes' Rule as part of his algorithms to greatly decrease false positive rates of unwanted e-mails ("spam").   Let $H^{c}$ be the event that an e-mail is "spam".  Let $W$ be the event that an e-mail contains a trigger word such as "watches".  Suppose that

- the probability that an e-mail contains that word given that it is spam is 17\%
- the probability that an e-mail contains that word given that it is not spam is 9\%
- the probability that a randomly selected e-mail message is spam is 80\%

Find the probability that an e-mail message is spam, given that the trigger word appears.

## Example: Quality Control

A manufacturing process produces integrated circuit chips.  Over the long run the fraction of bad chips produced by the process is around 20\%.  Thoroughly testing a chip to determine whether it is good or bad is rather expensive, so a cheap test is tried.  All good chips will pass the cheap test, but so will 10\% of the bad chips.  Given that a chip passes the test, what is the probability that the chip was defective?





## Example: DUI Checkpoint

A breath analyzer, used by the police to test whether drivers exceed the legal limit set for the blood alcohol percentage while driving, is known to satisfy

$$P(A|B) = P(A^{c}|B^{c}) = x$$
	
where $A$ is the event "breath analyzer indicates that legal limit is exceeded" and $B$ "driver's blood alcohol percentage exceeds legal limit."  On Saturday nights, about 4\% of the drivers are known to exceed the limit.

- Describe in words the meaning of $P(B|A)$
- Determine $P(B|A)$ if $x = 0.90$
- How big should $x$ be so that $P(B|A) \geq 0.95$?

## Example: Disease Outbreak

Suppose that at UC Merced, there is a two percent chance that a freshman has herpes at the end of the school year.  Let $H$ be the event of having the virus, while $C$ represents the event that the freshman is from the Cathedral dorm.  Among the herpes carriers, the probably of being a Cathedral resident is 32\%.  Among those free of disease, the probably of being a Cathedral resident is 13\%.  What is the probability that a freshman has herpes, given that you know that he or she lived in the Cathedral dorm?

## Generalized Bayes' Rule

If we are conditioning $B$ on an event $A$, where the latter can be partitioned into several subsets,

$$A = \{ A_{1}, A_{2}, ..., A_{j} \}$$

then the total probability is

$$P(B) = P(B|A_{1}) \cdot P(A_{1}) + P(B|A_{2}) \cdot P(A_{2}) + ... + P(B|A_{n}) \cdot P(A_{n})$$

and Bayes Rule for computing the probability of $A_{i}$ given $B$ becomes

$$P(A_{i}|B) = \ds\frac{ P(B|A_{i}) \cdot P(A_{i}) }{ P(B|A_{1}) \cdot P(A_{1}) + P(B|A_{2}) \cdot P(A_{2}) + ... + P(B|A_{n}) \cdot P(A_{n}) }$$

## Bayesian Odds

The **Bayesian odds** of event $A$ to event $B$ given that event $C$ has already taken place is
$$\ds\frac{ P(A|C) }{ P(B|C) }$$
