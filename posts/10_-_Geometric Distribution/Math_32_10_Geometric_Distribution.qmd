Here let us assume an endless box of chocolates with random selection with replacement of

\begin{itemize}
    \item  Probability $p$ of selecting a favorite chocolate
    \item  Probability $1-p$ of selecting an average chocolate
    \item  Stopping when a favorite is selected
\end{itemize}

Write out some of the sample space.	Let $F$ be the event of choosing a favorite chocolate, so $F^{c}$ is the event of choosing an average chocolate, $P(F) = p$ and $P(F^{c}) = 1-p$.  Let $k$ be the amount of chocolates chosen \textit{before} reaching a favorite chocolate

## Probability Mass Function

:::{.callout-note}
## Geometric Distribution Probability Mass Function

A **geometric distribution** is a discrete probability distribution with

- probability $p$ for "success"
- probability $1-p$ for "failure"
- for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$
- "success" on $(k+1)^{\text{th}}$ trial

The probability mass function (PMF) is

$$f(X = k) = (1-p)^{k}p$$

The cumulative mass function (CMF) is

$$F(X \leq k) = 1 - (1-p)^{k+1}$$

Ted Mosby is setting up his weekend plans.  Barney convinced him to try out an app called Tinder.  "Ted Mosby, Architect" has a 2/3 chance of setting up a date among those he "swipes right".  Suppose that Ted stops using Tinder this session once he sets up a date.

- Compute the probability that Ted needs exactly 4 ``swipes right'' to set up a date.
- Compute the probability that Ted needs at most 4 ``swipes right'' to set up a date.

## Complementary Cumulative Mass Function

When modeling with a geometric distribution---i.e. $X \sim Geo(p)$---the probability that "success" takes *more than* $k$ trials is

$$P(X > k) = (1-p)^{k+1}$$

Rebecca Bunch follows Josh Chan, whom she briefly dated as a teenager, by moving to West Covina, California.  Suppose that it may take a while for Rebecca and Josh to reunite and there is a 29 percent chance of them meeting during any particular week.  What is the probability that it will take Rebecca more than 3 weeks to reunite with Josh?

What is the probability that it will take Rebecca more than 9 weeks to reunite with Josh given that she has already spent more than 5 weeks in West Covina?

## Conditional Probability 2

Still holding on to that 29 percent chance of reuniting with Josh, compute the probability that it will take Rebecca more than 36 weeks to reunite with Josh given that she has already spent more than 32 weeks in West Covina.

## Memoryless Property

The previous two examples demonstrated the memoryless property. 

:::{.callout-tip}
## Memoryless Property
The geometric distribution is the only discrete probability distribution that has the **memoryless property**:

$$P(X \geq a + b | X \geq b) = P(X \geq a)$$
